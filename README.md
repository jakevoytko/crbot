CRBot
-----

CRBot is a Discord bot that you can teach to respond to user-defined
commands. CRBot is short for "Call and Response Bot". Commands are taught using
`?learn <call> <response>`, and can retrieve the response with `?call`.

It works really well for media retrieval; the Discord unfurler will inline
images, videos, etc.

This was initially a weekend project to see if my friends would like it. Now
that they haven't banned the bot (or me), I'm in the process of turning this
into something that's maintainable.

Example
--------

```
Jake: ?help
crbot: Type ?help for this message, ?list to list all commands, or
       ?help <command> to get help for a particular command.

Jake: ?learn bearshrug ʅʕ•ᴥ•ʔʃ
crbot: Learned about bearshrug

One of my friends: What's the weather tomorrow?
Jake: ?bearshrug
crbot: ʅʕ•ᴥ•ʔʃ
```
